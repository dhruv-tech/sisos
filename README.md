# SISOS (2015)

SISOS (Sign In Sign Out System) was a web application project that I worked on during my middle school days (Grade 10).

**It was conceptualised and built in collaboration with [Arjun Verma](https://www.linkedin.com/in/av777x/)**.

I primarily worked on the frontend, while Arjun primarily worked on the backend.

The architecture and code quality of the application is what you may expect from a middle school developer ðŸ˜….

## Introduction & Context

### The Problem

After school would end at 2:20pm (3:20pm on some days), some students would often stay back on the school's premises for a while - often to
study together with friends, play sports or to wait for a parent that worked at the school. 

But, this posed a problem - there would be no record of who was inside the premises if there were to be a fire or earthquake emergency.
The school had faced this issue first hand a few times during minor earthquakes earlier.

The school attempted to solve this by asking students to self-sign on a register at a far corner of the school, if they were staying back and sign out at an other 
register left at the main gate.

However, complience was low and handwriting was often not legible.

While, the school planned to replace regular ID Cards with NFC tags to solve this, that was still a few years away.

### Our Solution

Arjun observed this problem, we discussed it with the school and decided to build a Sign-In-Sign-Out System (SISOS) as an interim solution.

The idea was simple - the school gave email ids/active dirctory accounts to everyone. We'll make a responsive web app to allow students 
to login from their phone, laptop or any other device at the school if they are staying back. They'll be able to log out from a laptop 
left at the security desk on the school's main gate. If a school employee logs into the app, they'll see a list of all the 
students in the premises and could mark attendence as needed.
