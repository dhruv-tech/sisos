# SISOS (2015)

(Archieved)

SISOS (Sign In Sign Out System) was a web app I created during middle school, in collaboration with **[Arjun Verma](https://www.linkedin.com/in/av777x/)**.

I primarily worked on the frontend, while Arjun primarily worked on the backend.

*The architecture and code quality of the application are a reflection of our middle school developer skills ðŸ˜…*

## Introduction & Context

The application was built to address our school's problem with the lack of accurate attendance records for students staying after school - maintaining these records was important for various reasons, but most importantly for a situation where there were to be a fire or earthquake evacuation.

SISOS was developed as a responsive web app where students could sign in/out using school email accounts to indicate if they are present on the premises after official school hours. 

Staff could login and check attendance of students in the premises at any given time.

The app was deployed on the school's intranet for a while and used as a pilot/interim solution.

Flow of the app/solution:

* Student logs in using a personal or school device within 20 mins of the end of school.
* Student's location is verified, and attendence is logged.
* Student logs out using a school device placed on the security desk at the exit gate (enforced by security)
* If the student was logged-in, they are removed from the attendence list.
* If the student was not logged-in, they are logged for non-complinace and requested to comply with the process next time.

## Tech Stack 

* Data Store: Micorosoft SQL Sever.
* Backend: Java EE on Apache Tomcat Server.
* Authentication: Microsoft Active Directory.
* Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JS/JQuery, Zurb Foundation.
